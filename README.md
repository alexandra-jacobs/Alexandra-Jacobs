# About Me
I grew up in Indiana about 45 minutes south of Chicago and moved out to Denver, CO in 2021 for my position at MAXAR. I love snowboarding, hiking, bouldering, climbing, volleyball... pretty much any outdoor activity so Colorado has been a perfect fit for me! I am also an avid oil painter.
